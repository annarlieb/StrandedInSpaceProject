THEME: Space! You are an astronaut and unfortunately, your tether broke while fixing your spaceship 
    so you have to make it back to your spaceship. 

***********************************************************************************************************
*  OVERALL GAME OBJECTIVE: Make it back to your spaceship!! Each time you make it back to your spaceship  *
*  you will complete the level!                                                                           *
*  You can see how close you are to the spaceship on the top of the screen.                               *
*       Each level will present you with new objectives so be sure to read the pre-level screen to be     *
*       informed of what is unique about the upcoming level.                                              *

LEVEL-SPECIFIC OBJECTIVES: 
• LEVEL 1:
    • As you play you will be losing oxygen. Your oxygen level is displayed at the top of the screen.
    If you run out of oxygen you will fail. Thus, you must collect oxygen to survive. The blue oxygen 
    bubbles will increase your oxygen by 6.6% and the green oxygen tanks will increase your oxygen by 
    20%. Collecting additional oxygen when your oxygen is full will do no harm. 

• LEVEL 2:
    • Same oxygen mechanics as Level 1. 
    • You must avoid black holes. Colliding with a black hole will cause you to fail the level.  

• LEVEL 3:
    • Same oxygen mechanics as Level 1. 
    • Same black hole mechanics as Level 2. 
    • Your sense of direction is off-- each time you click the right arrow key you will move left and
    every time you click the left arrow key you will move right. Moving up and down works as usual. 

• LEVEL 4:
    • Same oxygen mechanics as Level 1. 
    • Same black hole mechanics as Level 2. 
    • Your sense of direction is retrieved. All arrow keys work in their appropriate direction.
    • You must avoid asteroids! Right before they come, you will see a warning, which tells you that
    an asteroid is about to fly by, coming from the location of the warning. If an asteroid hits you,
    you will fail the level. 

• LEVEL 5:
    • Same oxygen mechanics as Level 1. 
    • Same black hole mechanics as Level 2. 
    • Same asteroids mechanics as Level 4.
    • Your sense of direction is off again. This time, every time you click the up arrow you will go
    down and every time you click the down arrow you will go up.
